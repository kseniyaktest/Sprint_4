Sprint_4: the final project of the course "Testing web applications in Python"
In this project I created UI-tests for training service ["Yandex.Scooter"](https://qa-scooter.praktikum-services.ru/).

Tests "tests_part_about_important.py" check the drop-down list in the section "Questions about important". Tests "tests_order_scooter.py" check the order scooter from button "Order" in header and body of the page.

The Project was created in Python with Pytest framework, Selenium WebDriver.

I used Page Object Model and created an Allure-report.
